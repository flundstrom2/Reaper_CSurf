Some control surface drivers for REAPER DAW, based on the MCU driver in the
REAPER Plugin SDK December 16 2009.

Drivers included:
* Samson Graphite MF-8
* Novation LaunchControl XL (probably works with Novation LaunchControl as well)

NOTE: This is work-in-progress, and I offer no support.

KNOWN BUGS:
* LaunchControl implementation is non-complete; Device, Send Select, Send A/B
  are not implemented. Track Select LEDs are not implemented.

TESTING:
I've compiled these using Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition. Initially,
I converted the project from Visual Studio 6, to Visual Studio 2008, and
tested the 32-bit .DLLs against REAPER 4.78 x86. Then I converted the project
to Visual Studio 2013, and compiled x64, for testing with REAPER 4.78 x64.

My test setup is Windows 8.1 x64.

No further testing has been done on the 32-bit DLLs.
